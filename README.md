# Experts aggregation for air quality forecasting

Joint work with [Jean-Michel Poggi](http://www.math.u-psud.fr/~poggi/) and [Bruno Portier](http://lmi2.insa-rouen.fr/~bportier/)

---

This project gathers public material of a contract with [AirNormand](http://www.airnormand.fr/), located in Normandie (France). 
This institute is in charge of monitoring and forecasting the air quality in its region.
Private parts (intermediate reports, custom code) were stripped.

Several forecasting models are available, but it is difficult to choose one and discard the others, because 
the performances vary significantly over time. 
Therefore, the main goal of our study is to experiment several rules of experts (sequential) aggregation, and 
compare the performances against individual forecasters and some oracles.
